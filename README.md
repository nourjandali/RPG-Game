Add Player
* move realistically in the scene but can not fly (translate and rotate only on the 2 corresponding axis).
* if the player moves in the scene and collides with an object (e.g. tree, hills), - using AABB vs. AABB algorithm - a collision
should be triggered which does not let us move in that direction anymore.
